**Day 1** 
1. Creating the snake's body (starting with 3 squares) ✅
2. Moving the snake ✅
3. Control the snake with key bindings ✅

notes:
- when head is pointing down, shouldn't be able to go up
- pointing up? shouldn't be able to go down
- pointing left? shouldn't be able to go right
- pointing right? shouldn't be able to go left

**Day 2** 
4. Create food and detect collision with food ✅
5. Create a scoreboard ✅
6. Detect collision with wall ✅
7. Detect collision with tail ✅
